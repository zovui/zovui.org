       3、不支持分组数据，内部应用LongList组件优化dom渲染数量，因此暂不支持不规则列表项。\n            </h5>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nexport default {\n    data() {\n        return {\n            base: '',\n

<p style=\"color: red\">\n                <b>组件对数据的处理分为parse和format两部分</b>\n                <b>1、parse</b>\n                <br />v-model接收的值为date类型，date格式应该遵循js原生格式，也就是说能被\n                Date 对象验证通过的字符串。 <br />例如： <br />new\n                Date('2019.12.11') <br />new Date('2019/12/11') <br />new\n                Date('2019-12-11') <br />因此组件接受默认值得数据格式应该如下：\n                <br />'2019-11' <br />'2019' <br />'19' <br />'2019-2-03'\n                <br />['2011-05-06', '2012-06-09'] <br />......\n                <br />\n                <b>2、format</b>\n                <br />组件可以通过设置format字段自由组合date字符串，作为组件的输出。\n                <br />例如 <br />YYYY年MM月DD日，2019年12月20日\n                <br />YYYY=MM=DD，2019=12=20\n                <br />开发者也可以通过on-change事件的回调中对dayjs对象进行format\n            </p>\n            <b>format 格式：</b>\n            <table border=\"1px\">\n                <thead>\n                    <tr>\n
